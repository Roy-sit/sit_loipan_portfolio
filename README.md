#### Project: Portfolio
This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my work in fashion design, web development, and motion graphics. It includes interactive elements and smooth animations.


#### About Me
With a solid educational foundation in fashion and graphic design, backed by a degree from the UK, and many years of professional experience working with international fashion brands, I have honed my expertise in creating innovative and market-leading designs. My career has been defined by a strong sense of responsibility, a high work ethic, and a proven track record of delivering high-quality results.
Currently expanding my skill set by studying Interactive Media Design. My goal is to blend fashion and technology with a unique specialisation in website design, logo design, and motion graphic for fashion brands.
