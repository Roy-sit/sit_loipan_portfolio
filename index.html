                In this project, I use generators in Cinema 4D to create a pair of earbuds, and use the earbuds as a promotional asset for the print campaign and video. The print campaign will incorporate the earbuds into a poster design, while the video showcases the features of the earbuds including its colours, shapes, textures, lighting and animation keyframes.

                Illustrator: Initial sketch of the earbuds' shape.
                C4D: Shape the earbuds, add lighting and a backdrop to for the lighting quality. 
                Photoshop: Retouch the colour and contrast to enhance the images for posters.
